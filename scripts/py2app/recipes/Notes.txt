The albow.py file located here is a py2app recipe that allows StarTrekPy and the python albow package to load
its default-theme.ini file

We monkey patch this into the created virtual environment <venv-root>/lib/<pythonversion>/site-packages/py2pp/recipes

Don't forget to update the package's .__init__.py file to do

from . import albow
